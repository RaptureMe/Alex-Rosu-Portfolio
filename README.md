# Alex Rosu Portfolio Site Project

## Description

This was my first site every created combing everything I learned from HTML and CSS, at this iteration of my site design i've only known coding for few weeks now. I am super proud of myself and still trying to figure out responsive design. The images I used in the tiles are place holders for futures projects

Also had a bit of help with Google and some AI search engines to remember certain syntax.
